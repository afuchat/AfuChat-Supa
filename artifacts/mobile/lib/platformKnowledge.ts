// ── Platform identity & founder ──────────────────────────────────────────────
export const FOUNDER_AND_IDENTITY = `
## AFUCHAT PLATFORM IDENTITY & FOUNDER

- **Platform**: AfuChat — Uganda's social super-app. Combines messaging, social networking, AI, Wallet services, freelance marketplace, e-commerce, and community tools in a single app.
- **Founded in**: Uganda 🇺🇬 — built to serve Africa's social, payment, and communication needs.
- **Founder & CEO**: **Amkaweesi** — the founder and CEO of AfuChat. AfuChat handle: @amkaweesi.
  - To view the founder's profile use [ACTION:View @amkaweesi:/@amkaweesi]
  - Amkaweesi built AfuChat to give Africans a home-grown super-app that rivals WeChat, WhatsApp, and TikTok combined.
`;

// ── Username marketplace knowledge ───────────────────────────────────────────
export const USERNAME_MARKET_KNOWLEDGE = `
## USERNAME MARKETPLACE & BOUGHT USERNAMES

### What are bought usernames?
Any handle acquired via the Username Market (/username-market) becomes a "bought username" owned by the buyer.  Every owned handle is an alias that points to the SAME profile — so @bestgamer and @john both lead to John's profile if John owns both.

### Rarity tiers (by handle length)
| Tier | Length | Badge |
|---|---|---|
| Legendary | ≤ 4 characters | 👑 |
| Rare | ≤ 6 characters | 💎 |
| Uncommon | 7–9 characters | ⭐ |
| Common | 10+ characters | · |

### Key rules
- A user can own **multiple usernames** but has one active display handle at a time.
- **Destination of any bought username** = the owner's profile page — navigate to /@handle to see who it belongs to.
- Usernames are traded using ACoins. Sellers list them with a price; buyers pay and the handle is instantly transferred.
- Purchased handles appear in Profile → Collections → Username Collection.

### AI instructions for username questions
- "Where does @handle go?" → use [ACTION:View @handle:/@handle] to show the profile that owns it.
- "Who owns @handle?" → use [ACTION:Look up @handle:/@handle]
- "Buy a username" → use [ACTION:Username Market:/username-market]
- "Sell my username" → use [ACTION:Username Market:/username-market]

// ── Verification knowledge ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
export const VERIFICATION_KNOWLEDGE = `
## VERIFICATION ON AFUCHAT

### Two types of verified badge

**1. Personal Verification — Blue ✓ Checkmark**
- Appears next to the name of individual users, creators, journalists, and public figures.
- Confirms the account is real and belongs to who it claims to be.
- **How to get it:**
  - **Fastest route:** Upgrade to Gold or Platinum premium plan — the verified badge is included with both tiers.
  - **Manual review route:** Notable accounts (celebrities, activists, public officials, journalists) can apply for free. AfuChat reviews the application and may approve without a premium plan.
- Once granted, the badge stays active as long as your account is in good standing.
- The badge cannot be transferred — even if you sell your username, the badge remains tied to your account, not the handle.

**2. Organisation Verification — Gold ◆ Business Badge + Square Avatar**
- Appears on company, brand, NGO, government body, and educational institution profiles.
- The profile picture is displayed as a **square** (not circular) with a gold outline — visually distinct from personal accounts.
- **How to get it:** Apply via Settings → Business → Apply for Organisation Verification.
- Requirements: official business registration, legitimate email domain, minimum presence/follower threshold.

### What Verification Unlocks
- Higher trust and credibility with other users
- Elevated ranking in search results
- Access to advanced analytics (organisation accounts)
- Unlocks the "Creator" monetisation programme
- Silver subscription badge is shown separately and does not include verification — only Gold+ includes the checkmark

### Email & Phone Verification (Account Security)
- Separate from the social verified badge — this is basic account security.
- **Email verification:** Done at registration (6-digit code to your email). Re-trigger in Settings → Security → Verify Email.
- **Phone verification:** Optional but recommended — adds 2-step recovery. Settings → Security → Add Phone Number.
- **Two-factor authentication (2FA):** Settings → Security → Two-Factor Authentication. Strongly recommended.

### Common Questions AfuAI handles about Verification
- "How do I get verified?" → Explain Gold/Platinum path for speed, manual review for notable accounts. Add [ACTION:Premium Plans:/premium]
- "Am I verified?" → Check USER CONTEXT — if Premium shows Gold or Platinum, the user has a verified badge.
- "What is the blue checkmark?" → Explained above.
- "Difference between Gold/Platinum badge and Org badge?" → Personal = blue circle ✓ · Organisation = gold square ◆
- "Apply for business/org verification" → [ACTION:Settings:/settings] then navigate to Business section
- "My badge disappeared" → Ask user to check their subscription status — badge requires active Gold/Platinum plan (or manual approval).
